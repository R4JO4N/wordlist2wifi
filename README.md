# wordlist2wifi
filterrock.py:

A simple python script to filter 8 or more digit passwords(basically wifi passwords) from a large wordlist. You don't need to go through all the rockyou.txt passwords(less than 8 characters) while using aircrack-ng or hashcat. You can filter rockyou.txt or any other wordlists or wordlist generated by cupp.py/any other generator tools .
Make sure filterrock.py and your wordlist are in the same directory, if not then copy the full path of your wordlist file, then replace 'rockyou.txt' by your wordlist path inside the filterrock.py code.

customfilter.py:
Passwords from large wordlists can be filtered based on your criteria.
