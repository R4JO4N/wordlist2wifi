# wordlist2wifi
A simple python script to filter 8 or more digit passwords(basically wifi passwords) from a large wordlist. You don't need to go through all the rockyou.txt passwords(less than 8 characters) while using aircrack-ng or hashcat. You can filter rockyou.txt or any other wordlists or wordlist generated by cupp.py/any other generator tools .
Make sure filterrock.py and your text file are in the same directory, if not then copy the full path of your wordlist file and replace 'rockyou.txt' by your wordlist path inside the filterrock.py code.
